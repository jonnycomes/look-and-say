A module for exploring look and say sequences in the spirit of John H Conway.


* Free software: MIT license
* Check out the 'documentation here'_.


The theory of standard look and say sequences is explained in Conway's delightful article 'The Weird and Wonderful Chemistry of Audioactive Decay'_. 

For an introduction to nonstandard look and say sequences, see the 'notes here'_.



Projects that used the look_and_say module
------------------------------------------

- A D3 force graph showing 'the decay of Conway's elements'_.

- A D3 collapsable tree showing the `descendants of Methuselum`_.


Acknowledgments
---------------

- The initial implementation of the proof() method in the Cosmology class was written by Ethan Bassingthwaite and Monika de los Rios in the Spring of 2022 at The College of Idaho. We followed the strategy of Zeilberger's proof with implementation similar to that of Litherland.
