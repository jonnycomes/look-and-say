A python module for exploring look and say sequences in the spirit of John H Conway.

The following assumes familiarity with the terminology and notation for look and sequences introduced by Conway in his delightful article [The Weird and Wonderful Chemistry of Audioactive Decay](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4612-4808-8_53). 

This module can be used to recover several of Conway's results on standard look and say sequences. Additionally, it can be used to discover new results on various nonstandard look and say sequences. For an introduction to nonstandard look and say sequences, see the [notes here](https://jonnycomes.github.io/look_and_say/papers/intro_nonstandard_look_and_say/look_and_say_intro.pdf).
