- D3 visualizations of Conway's chemistry:

    - A D3 force graph showing [the decay of Conway's elements](https://observablehq.com/@jonnycomes/the-decay-of-conways-look-and-say-elements).

    - A D3 collapsable tree showing the [descendants of Methuselum](https://observablehq.com/@jonnycomes/descendants-of-methuselum).
