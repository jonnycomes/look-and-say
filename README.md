# look_and_say
A python module for playing with look and say sequences in the spirit of John Conway.

Check out the [documentation here](https://jonnycomes.github.io/look-and-say/html/look_and_say.html).

The mathematical theory of standard look and say sequences is explained in Conway's delightful article [The Weird and Wonderful Chemistry of Audioactive Decay](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4612-4808-8_53). 

For an introduction to nonstandard look and say sequences, see the [notes here](https://jonnycomes.github.io/look-and-say/papers/intro_nonstandard_look_and_say/look_and_say_intro.pdf).
